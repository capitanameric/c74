       <h3>NEW SCHOOL CANTEEN</h3> 
       <img src="canteen.jfif" class="img-responsive col-ig-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
       <p class="list-group-item-text col-ig-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Every school has a canteen and it makes it easy for students to get food from these canteens.

        On a busy day when mothers dont get time to pack lunchboxes or snack boxes, these canteens are really handy and a lifesaver.
        
        Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.

        Our canteen provides all kinds of food. You would get the vegetarian food and the non-vegetarian food. You have the rice varieties which may include the normal meals or fried rice and also fast food kind of items which includes sandwiches, rolls, wraps, burgers etc.</p>
